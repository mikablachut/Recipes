## Description

<details>
<summary>Click here to see general information about the <b>Project</b>!</summary>
  
  
A multi-user web application that allows storing, retrieving, updating and deleting recipes. Each user can search for recipes by category or name. The serivce          supports registration process and allows users (after logon) to add their own recipes and to update, delete and search this recipes by ID.

The idea for project comes from [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) Java Beckend Developer track.

## Technologies

<ul>
  <li>Java 17</li>
  <li>Spring Boot</li>
  <li>Spring Boot Security</li>
  <li>Spring Data</li>
  <li>Hibernate</li>
  <li>H2</li>
  <li>Gradle</li>
  <li>JUnit</li>
  <li>REST API</li>
  <li>Project Lombok</li>
</ul>

## Setup

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. The application uses H2 as the database by default.

### Gradle

<b>Java 17 is required for this step.</b>

Clone repository and enter its folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/dominikablachut/Recipes.git
cd Recipes
```

Now you can run the app using Gradle:

```
gradle bootRun
```

Application can also be started using ```java -jar``` command but for that, you need to generate jar file.
Steps for this scenario:

```
gradle build
java -jar .\build\libs\recipes-2.7.2.jar
```

## Endpoints

When you start the application a H2 database containing initial tables will be automaticly created. You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com) or any similar program for testing the APIs.

### Register User Endpoint

Endpoint receives a JSON object with two fields: email (string), and password (string). If a user with a specified email does not exist, the program saves (registers) the user in a database and responds with 200 (Ok). If a user is already stored in the database, the application responds with the 400 (Bad Request) status code. Both fields are required and must be valid: email should contain '@' and '.' symbols, password should contain at least 8 characters and shouldn't be blank. If the fields do not meet these restrictions, the service should respond with 400 (Bad Request). 

POST method

```POST /api/register```    request without authentication

Request body:

```json
{
   "email": "Cook_Programmer@somewhere.com",
   "password": "RecipeInBinary"
}
```
<details>
<summary><b>Sample response</b></summary>
  Stasus code: 200 (Ok)
</details>


### Add Recipe Endpoint

Endpoint receives a recipe as a JSON object and returns a JSON object with an ID field. This is a uniquely generated number by which we can identify and retrieve a recipe later. The application accept only valid recipes – all fields are obligatory, name and description shouldn't be blank, and JSON arrays should contain at least one item. If a recipe doesn't meet these requirements, the service should respond with the 400 (Bad Request) status code. Only a register user can add a recipe. If a user is not register, but he try to carry out the action mentioned above, the service should respond with the 401 (Unauthorized) status code.

POST method

```POST /api/recipe/new```   request without authentication

### Update Recipe Endpoint

Endpoint receives a recipe as a JSON object and updates a recipe with a specified ID. The server should return the 204 (No Content) status code. If a recipe with a specified ID does not exist, the server should return 404 (Not found). The server should respond with 400 (Bad Request) if a recipe doesn't follow the restrictions indicated above in section [Add Recipe Endpoint](#add-recipe-endpoint). Only an author of a recipe can update it. If a user is not the author of a recipe, but he try to carry out the action mentioned above, the service should respond with the 403 (Forbidden) status code.

### Get Recipe Endpoint

Endpoint returns a recipe with a specified ID as a JSON object (where {id} is the ID of a recipe). The server should respond with the 200 (Ok) status code. If a recipe with a specified ID does not exist, the server should respond with 404 (Not found). Only a register user can search a recipe. If a user is not register, but he try to carry out the action mentioned above, the service should respond with the 401 (Unauthorized) status code.

GET method

```GET /api/recipe/1``` request with basic authentication; email (login): Cook_Programmer@somewhere.com, password: RecipeInBinary

Path Variable:
```java
long id
```

### Search Recipe Endpoint

Endpoint takes one of the two mutually exclusive query parameters:
- category – if this parameter is specified, it returns a JSON array of all recipes of the specified category. Search is case-insensitive, the recipes are sorted by date(newest first).
- name – if this parameter is specified, it returns a JSON array of all recipes with the names that contain the specified parameter. Search is case-insensitive, the recipes are sorted by date(newest first). If no recipes are found, the program should return an empty JSON array. If 0 parameters were passed, or more than 1, the server should return 400 (Bad Request). The same response should follow if the specified parameters are not valid. If everything is correct, it should return 200 (Ok).
Only a register user can search a recipe. If a user is not register, but he try to carry out the action mentioned above, the service should respond with the 401 (Unauthorized) status code.

Request parameter:

```java
String category
```

or 

```java
String name
```
